# Bangladeshi Fresh-Rotten Fruit and Vegetable Detection Using Deep Learning Deployment in Effective Application.
<p>
This project addresses fruit and vegetable spoilage in Bangladesh using deep learning and computer vision. A device powered by a CNN algorithm was developed to classify fresh and rotten produce, outperforming KNN and SVM models. An Android app was also created for easy access, allowing users to take a photo and get instant results. This innovation aims to reduce waste and benefit farmers, businesses, and the public.
